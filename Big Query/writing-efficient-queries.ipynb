For example, you might write a query you expect to run only once, and it might be working on a small dataset. In this case, anything that gives you the answer you need will do.\n\nBut what about queries that will be run many times, like a query that feeds data to a website? Those need to be efficient so you don't leave users waiting for your website to load.\n\nOr what about queries on huge datasets? These can be slow and cost a business a lot of money if they are written poorly.\n\nMost database systems have a **query optimizer** that attempts to interpret/execute your query in the most effective way possible. But several strategies can still yield huge savings in many cases.\n\n# Some useful functions\n\nWe will use two functions to compare the efficiency of different queries:\n- `show_amount_of_data_scanned()` shows the amount of data the query uses.\n- `show_time_to_run()` prints how long it takes for the query to execute."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"source":"\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\nfrom time import time\n\nclient = bigquery.Client()\n\ndef show_amount_of_data_scanned(query):\n    # dry_run lets us see how much data the query uses without running it\n    dry_run_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(dry_run=True)\n    query_job = client.query(query, job_config=dry_run_config)\n    print('Data processed: {} GB'.format(round(query_job.total_bytes_processed / 10**9, 3)))\n    \ndef show_time_to_run(query):\n    time_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(use_query_cache=False)\n    start = time()\n    query_result = client.query(query, job_config=time_config).result()\n    end = time()\n    print('Time to run: {} seconds'.format(round(end-start, 3)))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Strategies\n\n### 1) Only select the columns you want. \n\nIt is tempting to start queries with **SELECT * FROM ...**.

In this case, each row in each table has at most one match in the other table.\n\n![JOIN](https://i.imgur.com/fp7oMLq.png)\n\nAnother type of JOIN is an **N:1 JOIN**.  Here, each row in one table matches potentially many rows in the other table.  \n\n![JOIN](https://i.imgur.com/7PxE0Mr.png)\n\nFinally, an **N:N JOIN** is one where a group of rows in one table can match a group of rows in the other table. Note that in general, all other things equal, this type of JOIN produces a table with many more rows than either of the two (original) tables that are being JOINed.\n\n![JOIN](https://i.imgur.com/UsNZZoz.png)\n\nNow we'll work with an example from a real dataset.
